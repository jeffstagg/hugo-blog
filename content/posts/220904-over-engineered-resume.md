# Introducing the Over-Engineered Resume
A common question that comes up when a developer is fresh out of college and looking for experience is, "How can I show off a project when I haven't done anything outside of school?"
It's a valid question, and one that we all had to face at one point. How do you get that first bit of experience to get you going?

## The First Project
Everyone needs a "first" project. Something you can dive into, learn new things with, and something to show off your coding style. Or build one, if you're new to programming. My first project was a portfolio. I wanted something to show off the work that I would eventually do, and I needed something to put on github (it seemed really important to me at the time).

So, a decade later, I still recommend people build their own portfolio or resume. It's a useful project to have, and I can't count the amount of interviews I've been in where the team really doesn't know how to gauge a developer to see how they would work with their team, so it's helpful to have something to dive into with a development team.

## The Resume
We're going to be building out a resume. Simple enough, yeah? Well, in premise, yes. The goal of a resume is simply to give an overview of your experience and skillset, and to start a conversation with a team to see if you can be productive together.

This project will do more than list a few keywords and try to convince a recruiter that you can bring value to their clients. I want something I can show off. I want a set of code I can be proud of to put on my public github profile. I need something I can use to play with new tech. Ever see a new tool and think "I wish I had something I could use that in"? Why not take something simple and completely over-engineer it instead?

## The Plan
I'll be building out the Over-Engineered Resume in a series of blog posts. I'll be using the project to demonstrate techniques that I use in my work. Follow along, and show off your skills with me!
